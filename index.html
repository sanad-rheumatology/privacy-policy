        <h2><span class="section-number">3.</span> WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        
        <div class="in-short">
            <strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em>
        </div>

        <p><strong><em>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>

        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>
                    <li>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</li>
                    <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
                    <li>Support our marketing activities</li>
                    <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
                    <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller" under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a "data processor" on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the "data controller" responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.</p>

        <p><strong><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>

        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
            <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
            <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
            <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
            <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
            <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>

        <h3>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</h3>
        <p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Data Processing Agreements that include Standard Contractual Clauses are available upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>

        <h3>Binding Corporate Rules:</h3>
        <p>These include a set of Binding Corporate Rules ("BCRs") established and implemented by us. Our BCRs have been recognized by EEA and UK data protection authorities as providing an adequate level of protection to the personal information we process internationally.</p>

        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>

        <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases.

        <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.

        <h2><span class="section-number">13.</span> CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

        <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
